# ZOMBI Decompilation
A decompilation of ZOMBI (2012/2015)
This does not come with any of the actual game assets. You need a legal copy of the game from Steam or Ubisoft Connect in order to use this

This project is slow-going, don't expect it to be perfect, or for it to be completed in a short amount of time

Currently, in the GhidraDump folder contains the exported C code of the game using default settings in Ghidra. Some dependencies failed to load from the code (MSVCP dlls) because I used Ghidra on a MacOS system.
